https://github.com/rsallar/jira-board-enhancer-plugin/blob/master/public/images/icon128.png

Jira Enhancer is a browser extension designed to supercharge your Jira board experience. It injects a set of powerful, quality-of-life features directly into the Jira interface, helping you and your team stay more organized and efficient.

This extension focuses on providing clearer visibility into sub-tasks, enabling faster status updates, and optimizing screen real-estate, all without leaving your board.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Inline Sub-Task Display**: See all sub-tasks directly on the parent issue card. No more clicking into each issue to check sub-task status.
-   **Quick Status Change**: Update the status of any sub-task directly from the board view with a custom status selector.
-   **Collapsible First Column**: Collapse the first column of any swimlane to maximize horizontal space, perfect for focusing on `In Progress` or `Done` columns.
-   **Enhanced Tooltips**: Custom, non-intrusive tooltips for long sub-task titles.
-   **Assignee & Priority Visibility**: Key information like assignee avatars and priority icons are clearly visible for each sub-task.

## üõ†Ô∏è Board Requirements & Configuration

For the extension to function correctly, your Jira board must be configured in a specific way.

### 1. Enable Swimlanes
The feature to collapse the first column is only available on boards that are organized by **Swimlanes**. You can configure this in `Board settings` ‚Üí `Swimlanes` and group by "Assignees", "Epics", "Queries", etc.

### 2. Add "Sub-Tasks" Field to Cards
To display the inline sub-tasks, you must add the "Sub-Tasks" field to your card layout.
-   Navigate to your board.
-   Go to **Board settings ‚Üí Card layout**.
-   Add **"Sub-Tasks"** to the list of displayed fields for your issue types.

 
*<-- Replace this with a URL to your screenshot showing the "Card layout" settings.*
